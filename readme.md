# Arithmetic operations using LLMs

Here, we only deal with additions.

## What are the files?
- json/additions_r1.json : contains the generated dataset of additions and responses from Deepseek-R1:1.5B model.
- json/additions_error.json : contains actual_answer and extracted answer from the response of the model.
- json/output.json : contains the response from the critic model(here, Gemini 2.0 flash thinking experimental model) and answer extracted from the response of the critic model as well. 

1465 entries generated initially

1176 of them had errors

1051 of them got correct answers from Gemini(present in the json/output.json)
